Ensure tkinter is installed: sudo apt install python3-tk.

Make executable: chmod +x fake_virus_alert.py.

Run: ./fake_virus_alert.py.

Effect: A GUI window pops up with a scary "virus detected" message and a countdown timer. When the timer reaches zero, a message reveals the troll. The random countdown adds unpredictability.
